# BetterEmployees
SMT (Supermarket Together) BepInEx mod

## Current features:
- Fix cashiers randomly stopping scanning items
- Restocker and storage employees remember where types of product are in the storage and try to respect the order
- Restockers will prioritize more empty shelves
- Restockers won't steal the job from another restocker anymore (they will check the products other employees are already restocking)

## How to  download
- Download [BepInEx for your computer (usually windows x64)](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/)
- Download [the latest release of the mod](https://github.com/IkaOverride/BetterEmployees/releases)
- Open each .zip and extract all files/folders to your game directory ([how to find the game directory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL8eB21q01s))

## Planned features:
- Enable/disable every feature
- Make employees not update the storage order
- Remove the saved order on a storage shelf, product shelf, fridges, and freezers, by cleaning it with a broom. This will stop restockers from restocking the shelves and stop restockers and storage employees from thinking a box should be there
- Save data so restockers and storage employees remember where they need to put boxes between each game restart
- Speed perk also increase customers putting items, cashiers scanning items, and restockers putting item on shelves
- (Maybe in another mod) Save boxes on the ground
