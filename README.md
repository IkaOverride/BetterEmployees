# BetterEmployees
SMT (Supermarket Together) BepInEx mod

Current features:
- Fix cashiers randomly stopping scanning items
- Restocker and storage employees remember where types of product are in the storage and try to respect the order
- Restockers will prioritize more empty shelves
- Restockers won't steal the job from another restocker anymore (they will check the products other employees are already restocking)

Planned features:
- Enable/disable every feature
- Make employees not update the storage order
- Remove the saved order on a storage shelf, product shelf, fridges, and freezers, by cleaning it with a broom. This will stop restockers from restocking the shelves and stop restockers and storage employees from thinking a box should be there
- Save data so restockers and storage employees remember where they need to put boxes between each game restart
- (Maybe in another mod) Save boxes on the ground
